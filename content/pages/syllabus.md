Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Textbook
--------

Apostol, Tom M. _Calculus, Volume 1: One-Variable Calculus, with An Introduction to Linear Algebra_. Waltham, Mass: Blaisdell, 1967. ISBN: 9780471000051.

(Vol. 2 will be needed for those who wish to continue on to 18.024 Multivariable calculus with theory.)

Additional [course notes](http://ocw2.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-014-calculus-with-theory-fall-2010/course-notes) by James Raymond Munkres, Professor of Mathematics, Emeritus, are also provided.

Prerequisites
-------------

We will assume a working knowledge of Calculus I ([_18.01 Single Variable Calculus_](/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006)), but no familiarity with proofs or proof writing.

Description
-----------

We will cover the same material as 18.01 but with an emphasis on proofs and conceptual understanding rather than computation. Topics include:

*   Axioms for the real numbers;
*   The Riemann integral;
*   Limits, theorems on continuous functions;
*   Derivatives of functions of one variable;
*   The fundamental theorems of calculus;
*   Taylor's theorem;
*   Infinite series, power series, rigorous treatment of the elementary functions.

Recitation Assignments
----------------------

At the beginning of each unit, students will receive a schedule that includes problems to complete in advance of the next recitation. Students should be prepared to present their proofs in clear detail. This will give them the opportunity to very deliberately improve their proof writing skills.

Problem Sets
------------

Problem sets are assigned weekly, and due the following week. At the end of the course, the lowest two pset scores for each student will be replaced by his or her average score on all of the psets.

Exams
-----

There will be three in-class, one hour exams, and one three-hour comprehensive final exam.
